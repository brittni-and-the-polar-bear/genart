## Socket Score Improvement Test

<a href="https://github.com/brittni-and-the-polar-bear/generative-art-library_base/issues/42" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See GitHub Issue</a>

- [x] record current Socket score (score = 58)
- [x] record current bundle size (size = 64.3 KB)
- [x] remove terser and minifying from library
- [x] release a new version
- [ ] wait for Socket score to be calculated
- [ ] record new Socket score (score = `REPLACE ME`)

If we see a significant improvement, we will remove minifying from all libraries. This will mean that the color and
palette libraries will need to be split up.
