## Color Library Explorer

Users should be able to view the color, its relevant values (HEX, RGB, HSL), its name, and a list of the palettes it is
featured in.

- [ ] get list of colors to put into explorer
- [ ] colors to cover
- [ ] automate page
  creation ([See the GitHub Issue](https://github.com/brittni-and-the-polar-bear/generative-art-library/issues/25))

## Color Comparison Page

A page that allows you to enter two color values and see swatches of the colors side by side to determine if there is
any discernible difference between them.

palette colors, name, source, and follow links to the color explorer page of each color.
